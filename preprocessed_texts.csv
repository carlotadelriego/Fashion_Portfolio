"9 Outdated Fashion Trends That Vogue Editors Still Love in 2025 | VogueSkip to main contentSearchSearchFashionBeautyCultureLivingWeddingsRunwayShoppingChevronVideoVogue ClubPhotoVogueFashionBeautyCultureLivingWeddingsRunwayMoreChevronOpen Navigation MenuMenuNew ArrivalsSpring Hero BuysEditor Wish ListsUnder $ 300Trending NowWardrobe EssentialsTrends9 Outdated Fashion Trends That Vogue Editors Still Love in 2025By Christian AllaireMarch 6 , 2025Photos : Collage by Vogue / Getty ImagesSave this storySaveSave this storySaveProducts are independently selected by our editors . We may earn an affiliate commission from links . Back in January , Timothée Chalamet stepped out in New York City wearing a serious throwback piece : An Alexander McQueen skull scarf . Having reached its peak in the late 2000s during the indie sleaze movement , that edgy skull - print scarf was worn by all the It girls at the time — from Lindsay Lohan to Mary - Kate Olsen — and is now considered a designer relic of the past . Outdated , even . But as Chalamet ’s revival of it proves , who says something has to be out - of - style ? When styled right , even the most forgotten fashion pieces can still feel fresh . The fashion moment got us thinking : Being trendy is seriously overrated , anyways . Sure , updated silhouettes and brand - new pieces can inject your wardrobe with a sense of newness — but should n’t our wardrobes be more personal and authentic ? If you love that McQueen scarf from a decade ago , you should be able to wear it in 2025 — it ’s your life ! Inspired by this approach to dressing , Vogue did a staff poll , to see which outdated pieces our editors are still wearing with pride . What made the cut ? Everything from Ugg boots ( Y2 K , baby ) to skinny jeans . Love them or loathe them , that is not the point : The point is , we all have our fashion obsessions that we will never retire , even if they fall out of style . And guess what : Embrace it . Below , 9 Vogue editors weigh in on the outdated fashions they still love . CrocsIf you love me at my Simone Rocha x Croc bejeweled collab , you also need to love me when I 'm walking the dog in my ugly - classic low - heeled Crocs that are stained with paint and dirt . Granted , these were never necessarily in   style , but that means they 're also never out of it ! — Emma Specter , culture writerSimone Rochax Crocs embellished Stomp clogs$250 BERGDORF GOODMANCrocsclassic clogs$50 NORDSTROMCommon Projects sneakersOn my feet , still : Common Projects 's   Bball sneakers in white . In my head , still : the formative years of f - ed up white sneakers that was the Brit - grunge Corinne Day era of the ' 90s . I know quite a few people have moved on from white sneakers , but give up my Common Projects ? Never . — Mark Holgate , global network lead & US fashion news directorCommon ProjectsBBall leather sneakers$530 MR PORTERCommon Projectsleather low - top sneakers$482 SAKS FIFTH AVENUEAlexander McQueen skull scarvesI have clung onto my Alexander McQueen skull scarf since first buying it back in 2011 . ( I bought it as a gift to myself , after seeing the McQueen exhibition “ Savage Beauty ” at the Met . ) I have always thought the scarf adds a perfect grungy - cool feel to any basic outfit . Plus , seeing Timothée Chalamet recently revive it on the red carpet ? It ’s officially back , baby ! — Christian Allaire , senior fashion & style writerMcQueenSkull silk scarf$395 SAKS FIFTH AVENUEMcQueenSkull silk scarf$390 NEIMAN MARCUSSkinny jeansMy sartorial guilty   pleasure is somewhat controversial : I recently unearthed a pair of skinny jeans . You read that right — category is Hedi Slimane 's Dior Homme circa 2004 ! Except that I 'll never be as thin ( or tall ! ) as those models . It all happened because a designer friend who is known for his denim challenged me to give them a try . I have been predicting the return of skinnies for a year now , and I think it 'll happen this fall . Much of it has to do with the terrifying swinging of the fashion pendulum back to everything thin   in the age of Ozempic — but alas ! I decided to not let this get to me and find out if I can have fun with skinny jeans like I used to a decade or so ago . The verdict is : Not no . I wore a pair with an oversized blazer and this Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation - era leather hat . The look was an amalgamation of fashion eras and styles that , to my dismay , worked . I do n't think I 'll return to skinnies on a regular basis — they're simply too hard to take off ! But my takeaway   is : Never say never . — José Criales - Unzueta , fashion news editorDiorsllim - fit jeans$950 DIORFramePencil jeans$268 FRAMEProenza Schouler PS1 bagsI have always loved the Proenza PS1 bag . I could never afford them when they were official It - bags , though I have vivid memories of going to the Opening Ceremony store on Howard and sighing while looking at the display in tiny room in the second floor : They had them in every color and every material , and it was like heaven . For their spring 2013 collection , which I think is my all - time favorite Proenza collection , they did these super cool collages   with photographic prints . They said it was influenced by Tumblr , and as a certified   girl at night on the internet , I totally got it . That season , they did a PS1 in the people - print leather , and I became completely obsessed . I always looked for it on eBay and the RealReal — it popped up once , during the pandemic , but I guess I was being sensible and thought "" why would I buy a bag during the pandemic ? "" The day that I opened the app and saw that it had been sold I was instantly filled with a deep regret : how could I have let it go ? And so for the past 3 or 4 years I had been crawling the internet , sure that if I ever came across the bag again , I would not let it get away from me . Finally in November of last year , another one popped up on TheRealReal . I sent a link to my husband : "" Here 's something you could get me for Christmas . "" He 'd already bought me a present , but he got it for me anyway . I 've been carrying it every day since — it just fits everything ! It 's funny because during fashion week , everyone saw it and asked the same question "" Is the PS1 back ? "" I ca n't tell you if the PS1 is "" back "" or not , all I know is that I 've wanted this   PS1 for a long - ass time and it 's finally mine . It 's not a guilty pleasure , it 's just a pleasure - pleasure . — Laia - Garcia Furtado , senior fashion news editorProenza Schouler PS1 medium bag$2,290 PROENZA SCHOULERProenza SchoulerPS1 tiny nubuck shoulder bag$2,190 NET - A - PORTERLow - rise jeansThe low - rise movement made me realize that a lower - slung silhouette is actually a suitable proportion for my body . I often encountered puzzling moments when getting dressed and wondering why things were n't adding up with my shirts and jackets and high - rise pants the way I had imagined them in my head . How could they be this hard to style ? Having figured out why , I now love the way a pair sits low around my hips versus up past my belly button , giving a bigger canvas for whatever I 'm wearing on top to exist . There 's nothing better than when the bottom of my sweaters brush the top of a pair of low - waist tailored trousers perfectly , or not having to stuff almost half my button - down shirt into high - rise pants . Trends be damned , I 'll be sticking to lower rises for more elongating , flattering fits . — Madeline Fass , senior market editorKhaiteLenton pants$1,480 KHAITEMassimo Duttistraight - leg low - rise cotton jeans$100 MASSIMO DUTTIUgg bootsI made it almost 30 years before I was gifted a pair of Uggs . The moment I slid my typically platform shoe - d feet into the shearling shoes ( these were a pair of Minis ) was a revelation — oh my god ,   I understood the hype . Uggs are somehow both warm in the wintertime and cool in the summertime . They are so comfortable that it does feel like you 're walking on a comfy cloud . I could spend the entire day running errands , dinner , whatever in them . Anytime I switch out of my Uggs into a pair of hard shoes , my feet definitely feel a little sad about it — I wo n't deprive myself any longer ! — Margaux Anbouba , senior beauty and wellness editorUggClassic Ultra mini ankle boots$150 SAKS FIFTH AVENUEUggClassic Ultra mini ankle platform boots$160 FWRD3.1 Phillip Lim Pashli bagsI recently resurrected my 3.1 Phillip Lim Pashli , and it 's just as great of a work bag now as it was when I bought it nearly a decade ago .

 “ I ’ve had to disengage with labels of what kind of artist I am or what I do , ” says Simpson , in Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello , photographed in the Engelhard Court at New York ’s Metropolitan Museum , where her paintings will be exhibited in May . Photographed by Tina Barney . Sittings Editor : Max Ortega . Vogue , March 2025.Save this storySaveSave this storySaveNot many artists have found their way forward during an earthquake . Lorna Simpson , whose pioneering conceptual photographs and multimedia work over more than three decades had already established her as a major voice for Black feminist art , was in a residency program in Sonoma , California , on August 24 , 2014 , when the area was hit by a 6.0 tremor that killed two people and injured 300 others . “ It made me a bit fearless , ” she tells me . Lorna had been doing drawings and collages for the last few years . Recently she had started to feel the urge to move into something bigger and more ambitious — specifically , painting — but she had n’t painted since her first years in college , and she did n’t know how to go about it . “ You ’re just worried about making some paintings , and the earth is moving beneath you like a freight train ? ” she thought to herself . “ Just make some paintings ! Do n’t be so precious about it . There ’s this thing with me of taking risks and working blind and not being completely certain of what I ’m doing . It ’s like , just try it and see what happens . ” A year later , the much - admired curator Okwui Enwezor showed Lorna ’s first paintings at the Venice Biennale . And this May , the full range of her paintings over the past decade will be featured in an exhibition of their own at The Metropolitan Museum of Art . “For me , Lorna Simpson is a hero , ” says David Breslin , The Met ’s curator in charge of the department of modern and contemporary art . “ She is a conceptual artist who made us rethink what conceptual art was — what art was — at a particular moment . I see Lorna as one of those artists , with Barbara Kruger and Jenny Holzer and Louise Lawler , and also David Hammons , who uses every tool at their disposal to get their point across . I love the confidence of an artist who is willing to suggest that , ‘ I need to reinvent what you think of me , but I ’m not reinventing myself . I ’ve always been this way . ’   ” Two works in dialogue : In Furs , a photo collage Simpson created in 2010 , and True Value , from 2015 , which portrays the same subject in a different medium — ink and acrylic on gessoed wood . © Lorna Simpson . Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth . 
 Growing up in New York — first Brooklyn , then Queens — Lorna was the only child of culture - loving parents ( Cuban Jamaican father , African American mother ) who took her to concerts and theater and ballet as well as to art museums . ( Lorna would do the same with her daughter , Zora Simpson Casebere , now an actor and writer living in Los Angeles , where Lorna has a house and visits often . ) “ I spent my childhood and young adulthood going to The Met , ” she says . This continued throughout her years at Manhattan ’s High School of Art and Design and later at the School of Visual Arts . “ In my first year of college , I went to see The Met ’s Zurbaráns , which are religious and very intense — out of the tradition of self - mutilation , adoration - for - God kind of paintings . And to this day , I remember looking at his painting of a woman , standing in a red cloak . It ’s a very tall painting and she ’s holding two breasts on a plate . ” ( The woman is Saint Agatha and the breasts are hers . ) “ The bodily mutilation and the calm , calm presentation — I thought it was crazy and also very powerful . That was a huge lesson for me , a demonstration of the power of imagery and subject matter and also of scale — not being big for big ’s sake , but when all of those things come together . ”Her first painting , True Value , did just that . Nine feet tall , larger than life , it shows a woman in a leopard - print dress and jacket , walking her pet cheetah on a leash . But something ’s off . The cheetah has the face of its owner , whose face is now the cheetah ’s . The image is taken from In Furs , a collage she made five years earlier , using a photograph from Jet magazine . Jet and Ebony are frequent sources for Lorna , who often mines her own work . In the painting she shifted the light from day to night : a dark , purple­-blue , midnight sky . “ There ’s such surrealness and absurdity in [ the Jet ] image itself , ” she says . “ I just reversed things , switching the head of the cheetah with the head of the woman . When I think of what it took to put that shoot together — they were out of their minds in a very beautiful and surreal way . ”Mind Reader , 2019 . © Lorna Simpson . Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth . Photo : James Wang . 
 When Lorna wanted to start painting in 2015 , she called her friend the artist Glenn Ligon . “ Not sure what I said to Lorna back then , ” Glenn tells me . “ My joke with my artist friends is that when there is some hot new painter that everyone is talking about , I ask , ‘ What is the work about ? ’ And often it ’s a question no one can answer . When Lorna started painting again , her paintings were about what they had been about in her photo - based work : gender , history , memory , power . The difference is that when she started painting , the images carried the meaning , whereas in her photo work , language carried the meaning . Also , she began to work at a commanding scale . She became a history painter in a way , linked up to a tradition of large - scale paintings that dealt with the pressing issues of our time . ”Lorna ’s first painting show at Hauser & Wirth New York in 2019 was called “ Darkening , ” and it was a stunner . Huge landscapes took viewers into timeless arctic regions where cobalt blue and turquoise icebergs rose from cloudlike , frigid waters , and images of Black women seemed to appear and disappear . Bold , politically coded , and confident flights of the imagination marked Lorna ’s passage into yet another medium . Screen - printing images on gessoed panels , she used inks and acrylic paint at large scale . She used brushes of all sizes and sometimes walked on the images with her bare feet to create pooling and iridescence and opacity . She accomplished something of her own — she called them “ abstracted landscapes . ”“Big , brooding landscapes … contain a cascade of connections to her earlier art - making that manifest once the elements of method appear , making this new phase more an evolution than a break , ” Siddhartha Mitter wrote in The New York Times about the show . “ The tones and densities of ink merge land and water , cover horizon lines , streak and tumble across the frame . ”Painted work by Simpson . Vanish , 2019 , ink and screenprint on gessoed fiberglass . © Lorna Simpson . Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth . Vanish , Photo : James Wang . 
 Lorna , who was divorced in 2017 , concedes she is “ very evasive ” about her private life . “ I have a lover , ” she tells me , an artist whom she ’s known for a number of years , but they do n’t live together . “ In all my relationships — with my daughter , close friends , and lover — intimacy and making space for it is key . My dear friend Robin Coste Lewis reminded me during the pandemic of this excerpt from a letter by Rainer Maria Rilke : ‘ I hold this to be the highest task for a bond between two people : that each protects the solitude of the other . ’   ” A year ago , when Lorna was invited to do the exhibition at The Met , she was in the middle of working on her second painting show at Hauser & Wirth New York . Her subject this time was meteorites . She had been fascinated by Minerals From Earth and Sky , a book published by the Smithsonian in 1929 . It contained many photographic plates of meteorites , but what caught her attention was one that fell on a farm near Baldwyn , Mississippi , in 1922 , at the feet of a Black tenant farmer . Lorna delved into the records and was able to identify him as Ed Bush . “ What really captivated me about the text was a relationship between a landowner who ’s also a judge and his Black tenant farmer who goes unnamed , ” she says . “ And it was at a time when racial tension in the United States , particularly in Mississippi , was high and violent . But this was about Ed Bush ’s experience of having a meteorite fall at his feet . ” Particularly the sonic experience , she tells me : “ It was all about the sound . He heard it before it landed . ” She struggled with the idea of how to paint meteorites — rocks that were not just ordinary rocks — and this story opened the door . She wrote a note to herself with three thoughts on it : “ Black man . Mississippi . Meteorite . ”She began experimenting with silver and black acrylic paint to create an atmosphere of depth and radiancy . The paintings she made were so tall that she had to paint them on the floor of her studio in the Brooklyn Navy Yard . When I saw all nine of them together at Hauser & Wirth , in a room with a soaringly high ceiling , I was overwhelmed . Surrounded by monumental , luminescent portraits of objects from another world , I felt a quiet awe that I had n’t experienced since my first visit to Mark Rothko ’s Chapel in Houston .

 “ Lorna has a gift for exceeding whatever medium she chooses to work in , ” says Naomi Beckwith , deputy director and chief curator of the Guggenheim Museum . “ No surprise , then , that when she turns to painting her scale is large and her themes are larger than life — alpine landscapes , massive explosions , meteors from beyond our solar system . On the one hand , Lorna stays true to her longtime practice of appropriating vintage imagery , yet the scale and ambition of her paintings move into the realm of the sublime . ”The Met museum bought Did Time Elapse , one of the meteorite paintings . In this one , the object seems to be hovering in midair , ready to fall on your foot . It ’s more luminous and maybe more friendly than the others . “There ’s always this voice in your head , saying , ‘ Oh , but you ca n’t do that , ’ or ‘ That ’s such a departure from what you did before , ’   ” Lorna tells me . “ There are all these different kinds of voices that can curtail creativity . I ’ve had to disengage with labels of what kind of artist I am or what I do , because it ’s only confining . I can kind of do anything . ”“Lorna Simpson Simpson : Source Notes ” opens May 19 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art .

"" my joke with my artist friend be that when there be some hot new painter that everyone be talk about , i ask , ' what be the work about ?

Published : Jan 28 , 2025Save ArticleGray SorrentiCoat , bodysuit , Christian Dior . Tights , Calzedonia . Necklace , brooch , Tiffany & Co. Shoes , KNWLS.Here ’s the thing : Lady Gaga does n’t want to talk about herself . She will , because that ’s what ’s been asked of her throughout a 20 - year - long career spanning music ( 13 Grammys ) , film ( four Oscar nominations , one win ) , television ( four Emmy nominations ) , fashion ( where to start ! ) , and her very own beauty range ( Haus Labs ) . And she ’ll answer my questions with a disarming vulnerability and level of self - reflection . But , she admits toward the end of our afternoon together at her record label in London , “ I ca n’t tell you how much I wanted to ask you questions , too , this whole time . You have no idea how unnatural it is to meet someone and not be able to ask them about themselves .   I do n’t want to ruin the interview time for you , but I also want to give to people who give to me . ” And it ’s this that I find so surprising about meeting the icon , the idea , the moment , or , as she refers to herself at one point , “ the product ” that is Lady Gaga in person . Before me is a petite woman with artfully disheveled auburn hair and little makeup , wearing a vintage lace dress , oversize biker jacket , and ankle boots . She ’s funny , self - deprecating , warm , and comfortingly present . I ca n’t help but wonder what dark arts , what spell it is that transforms her into such a terrifyingly brilliant powerhouse of a performer . She ’s gearing up for the release of her seventh album , after what fans ( a.k.a . Monsters ) might consider creative detours , but she feels are all part of the same journey — an album of jazz standards with Tony Bennett , and Harlequin , a companion to the Joker sequel , Folie à Deux . The appetite for this record is huge . Her last pop album , Chromatica , dropped at the height of the pandemic and missed out on the hype it deserved . So the Monsters are hangry . I ’m here to tell them that her latest album , Mayhem , is a feast . She moves from the sofa where we ’ve been chatting to a chair by a mixing board , to play me the new songs . This is a moment a million Monsters would kill for , and once my gay panic subsides , I ’m taking it all in . Gaga bounces in her seat , stomps her black boots , and seems as excited to be listening to it as I am . I can not wait to be at a club surrounded by my queer friends dancing to this record .   It ’s euphoric , like a sharp inhale . I feel it in my chest , my heart . “ We need this ! ” I tell her . She smiles , sweetly relieved that I love it . The sound is hard to pin down . She describes one track as a “ happy apocalyptic tune ” and says her influences include “ ’ 90s alternative , electro - grunge , Prince and Bowie melodies , guitar and attitude , funky bass lines , French electronic dance , and analog synths . ” From a genre perspective , she says , “ Mayhem is utter chaos ! ” She adds the record "" just feels good to me . It sounds good . It breaks a lot of rules and has a lot of fun . ”When making music Gaga sees a wall of color — a phenomenon known as synesthesia . “ As I ’m writing , it assembles in my brain , then through the recording it becomes a full piece of color , ” she says . “ Every song is a different shade . A lot of the songs on this album have a maroon , brown color to them . ‘ Bad Romance ’ was like that — it was reddish . ”I ask how she knows if a song is going to be a hit . “ There are great records that I make that will have their moment of completion and I ’ll go , it ’s not a hit , but I love it , ” she says . “ Other records , I ’ll just know that it has everything it needs . A hit is very powerful at conveying that the energy in the artist is going to get transferred into the listener . ”Gray SorrentiTop , shorts , Rick Owens . Tights , Maison Margiela .

Whereas in the past Gaga might have approached a new album with a fully formed idea of the work she ’s about to make , knowing what it ’s going to be called and even what the art will look like , with this , she tells me “ I was actually pretty hard on myself about not walking into the studio with any preconceived ideas that I was going to strangle onto . Mayhem is about following your own chaos into whatever cranny of your life that it takes you to . And in that way , it was about following the songs . Writing as many songs as I did for this album was a labour of total love . And then you just have to be very cutthroat by the end . ”She confesses that , up until now , she had always felt it was her stage name , Gaga , that created the music . Now she recognizes that “ it came from me . I ’m the creator and I made all of it , and that helped me to value myself as a musician and a songwriter in a deeper way . ” I ask if this realization means she might drop the stage name . She looks aghast at the suggestion ( phew ! ) and rushes to say , “ No ! I love being Lady Gaga . I love being me . I just mean that I became a star when I was 20 . Everything gets reflected back to you that this persona is what makes you special . ”We talk about this separation of public and private self and how it has affected her over two decades . She admits to having “ a broken feeling ” about some of the mental health issues she has had in her life . “ I feel some embarrassment , and that ’s a very vulnerable thing to share . But I think through making this album , I was able to really love myself through all of that . Confronting the music was a way of confronting some of the things I ’ve been through and saying , ‘ It ’s okay that ’s who you are . ’ And celebrating that about myself , instead of trying to pretend it ’s not real . ” Gray SorrentiTop , gloves , Valentino . Necklace , Tiffany & Co. She tells me that making Mayhem was a process of rediscovery . “ The chaos I thought was long gone is fully intact and ready to greet me whenever I ’d like . Part of the message of even the first song on the album is that your demons are with you in the beginning and they are with you in the end , and I do n’t mean it in a bleak way . Maybe we can make friends sooner with this reality instead of running all the time . ” I wonder if embracing the darkness inside rather than trying to kill it with the artificial brightness of a spotlight has allowed Gaga to let in something softer , more natural , closer to sunshine . She ’s valuing the small moments at home with her friends , her dogs , and her fiancé , Michael Polansky , as much as , if not more than , the performances . “ Everyday poetry , ” she calls it . She explains that even though the “ Disease ” video is so dark in a way , the process of creating it was n’t painful . “ It was easier to make it [ once she was at peace with the darkness ] . It felt really fun and celebratory . Like throwing a party for all your demons . “I used to drink a lot and smoke a lot , and I was always looking for an out . I used to call it the trapdoor . And I stopped doing that . I actually started feeling it . Being present . ”After the interview , Gaga introduces me to Polansky , a 41 - year - old venture capitalist . Gaga ’s mother set the pair up after meeting him at a charity event and telling her daughter , “ I ’ve met your future husband . ” Polansky has a kind face and a gentle energy . He also reads as completely un - celebrity - coded ( despite being a multimillionaire himself ) , more like a good - looking dad you might chat with at the school drop - off . “What did you think of the music ? ” he asks me , proudly wrapping an arm around his wife - to - be . He grins when I say that I love it and then laughs , because it ’s not as if he made it . “You helped me loads , though , ” Gaga says , staring lovingly up at him . “ You helped write , like , seven songs!”Later , Polansky and I talk on the phone . He says : “ It ’s been one of the most incredible parts of this chapter of my life , to live with and coexist alongside someone making art and being creative in ways that very few people get to experience . I think of myself as really lucky to have been there for it . ” He ’s loved watching her evolve in the years they ’ve known each other , and particularly he says , “ return to finding a lot of joy in making art , performing , and writing music . ”“This album was so much fun to watch her make , ” he adds . “ She recorded it right down the street from our house , so we could easily walk back and forth from the studio . I spent a lot of time with her , bringing my laptop to work while she was there . What surprised me most was how fast she is . I could n’t believe how quickly a song would take shape . Within five minutes , 80 percent of the song would have come from nothing . ”   Gray SorrentiDress , headpiece , Issey Miyake . Necklace , brooch , Tiffany & Co.

I’m interested in what it ’s like navigating a relationship with someone so famous . “ Accepting that you wo n’t have the privacy others might have was the hardest part , ” he says . “ But Stefani ’s comfort with it and patience with me has been amazing . Our relationship is probably a lot like everyone else ’s . We just have to figure out how to do some of it in public . That makes it even more important for us to have strong friendships and close family relationships . We find normalcy where we can . ”With Polansky , Gaga ’s life has a different shade to it ; it ’s more wholesome . “ He used to say to me when we first met , ‘ You are a special human being when the cameras are n’t on you . And I get to see that all the time , ’ ” she tells me . They love to host at their L.A. home . “ We make pasta together ; we roast things . We also really like making simple dishes with Michael ’s mom , who lives nearby . ” It ’s no secret that Gaga gets on well with older people ( “ I loved Tony Bennett ” ) and calls her own mother one of her best friends , alongside Michael ’s mother , Ellen . “ She and I have built our friendship by sharing our life experiences with each other . It ’s about the way we grew up , being a woman in the workplace , what her experience was like and what mine is like , and kind of tracking different generations . ”Gray SorrentiDress , Gaga ’s own .

She tells me a story . “ A while ago my friend Margo was over , and we were talking about lots of things , but at some point I showed her the ‘ Disease ’ video , and she was smiling . And then she said to me , ‘ You know , this girl’”—that is , the one violently writhing around while chained to a pole , and the bloody - eyed , latex - clad demon puking up black bile—“‘well , she also makes great broccoli . ’ It was a really sweet moment where somebody that I love and care about knows that as much as I wanted her to like my video , making her dinner was the number one joy of my evening . ”Joy . There ’s a lot more of it in her life these days . She ’s finding it in “ real conversations , real relationships , the authentic stories that we share with each other . I think there ’s an element of ‘ Fake it till you make it ’ all the time in life … but I also believe in being real , with yourself and with people around you . And I think , sometimes , when we have those real conversations , we can feel less alone . ” We meet six days after the results of the American election are announced . Mayhem has been unleashed on a global political stage — no one could accuse Gaga of not reading the room . “ What ’s bizarre is I did not write this album thinking that this would happen . I prayed it would not . But here we are . ”Gaga endorsed Kamala Harris . She also performed at Biden ’s inauguration in 2021 , which she has previously called one of the proudest moments of her life . I ask how she ’s been feeling . “ The main thing is I have so much compassion and love for so many people who are afraid today . I want to acknowledge that I ’m a very blessed person , and I feel grateful for so much in my life every day . I know for a lot of people , this election was devastating for their existence , so community is going to be the number one thing . I am one of many people who support the [ LGBTQ and other marginalized ] communities . And we ’re not going down without a fight . We will stick together . It ’s going to be hard , but I ’m up for it . We ’re up for it . And I just want everyone to know how deeply they ’re loved and not invisible . ” Gray SorrentiBlouse , tights , gloves , Valentino . Necklace , Tiffany & Co. The music industry has changed so much since Lady Gaga released her first album , The Fame , in 2008 : social media , streaming , and , finally , music ’s own # MeToo moment , with some high - profile people being held accountable for their abuse of power . Right now , pop is celebrating strong women solo artists like never before and giving them the space to be themselves . Billie Eilish , Chappell Roan , Sabrina Carpenter , Charli XCX—“They’re amazing , ” Gaga says . “ They ’re strong and vibrant and creative and artistic . I think they ’re being celebrated because they ’re wonderful . ”If she could tell these younger pop artists anything , “ it would be that the whole you matters . Who you are at home is just as valuable as who you are when you ’re onstage . And no matter what anyone says to you , you can value who you are outside of all of this . ” She takes a beat then adds , “ I ’ve been in this business for years . Being a woman and a product at the same time was really exhausting . ”The artwork for the new album plays with this duality , but it ’s not as simple as public and private , good and bad , light and dark — it is about what she calls a “ radical acceptance ” of all of it — of the mayhem . She says she ’s “ having a lot of fun exploring imagery that is different from things that I ’ve done before . Things that used to really scare me are now really exciting . ”“Such as?”“Well , playing with transgressive and challenging themes that make me think of my own anxiety . I could n’t do that for a really long time . And now it ’s just what I naturally want to do . It ’s interesting that I could go through a period of being afraid as a person and wanting nothing to do with those themes and then feeling good now and being like , ‘ Let ’s do all this dark stuff . ’”The concept of radical acceptance comes up a lot during our chat , and feels key to the message she wants to convey about who she is and how she feels about her life and art right now . “ I ’m not going to torture myself , ” she says . “ I ’m going to celebrate . I used to drink a lot and smoke a lot , and I was always looking for an out . I used to call it the trapdoor . I used to be like , ‘ I need an escape route . ’ And I stopped doing that . And I actually started feeling it . Being present . As an artist , it ’s hard to go through that and not want to share that with my fans . ”Accepting that you wo n’t have the privacy others might have was the hardest part . But Stefani ’s comfort with it and patience with me has been amazing . ”—Michael PolanskyWe talk about failure , not a word I associate with the megastar . But Joker : Folie à Deux has had mixed reviews . “ People just sometimes do n’t like some things , ” she says matter - of - factly . “ It ’s that simple . And I think to be an artist , you have to be willing for people to sometimes not like it . And you keep going even if something did n’t connect in the way that you intended . ” She adds that the fear of failure is what can be really damaging : “ When that makes its way into your life , that can be hard to get control of . It ’s part of the mayhem . ”Embracing demons , darkness , nightmares , and the sprawling i d that bubbles just below the surface in all of us reminds Gaga of her love for Alexander McQueen , Isabella Blow , and Daphne Guinness : “ There are amazing artists throughout history who had a relationship to dark poetry as a way of feeling alive . ” But for Gaga , there were several years when she lost track of where the darkness began and ended . “ It was everywhere all the time . And that was not a sustainable life . ”“So now , the darkness is more specific or channeled ? ” I ask . “ Yeah , channel it in the music and onstage , but then in my life … ”“You’re making the broccoli?”“Exactly!”It remains to be seen just how being in this new place will affect Gaga ’s style and approach to fashion . On the ELLE shoot , she brought her own looks from home to try out and she ’s not about to stop having fun with the more outlandish costumes we love her for — in fact , the eponymous character of Mayhem who haunts this album and drives the car in the ‘ Disease ’ video presents ample opportunities to play with gothic subversion . But , Gaga tells me , “ I ’m just trying to feel as in my skin as possible and not like I ’m performing all the time . ”She adds , “ I feel really at ease about fashion and clothes . For me , I ’m at a place in my life where I just want to feel like myself in clothes . Whatever that means . So if that ’s changing , I just want to go with that feeling . ”Most recently , she ’s been wearing a lot of baby doll dresses , because she ’s become fascinated with porcelain dolls . “ They ’re so fragile . And they ’re beautiful too . ” She used to be scared of them , and we agree they ’re pretty freaky , but as with so many things now she ’s leaning into that old fear and reclaiming it . Family has always been a steadying force for Gaga . But now , for the first time , she ’s considering starting her own with Michael . “ Family — it ’s like the roots of the tree , ” she says . “ They grow long , and sometimes they ’re mangled , and sometimes they ’re full of water , and sometimes they ’re thirsty . Family is what makes you who you are , and it also defines your need for change . ”“If you were to have a child , ” I ask , “ what would you want them to understand about you as an artist and also as a person as they grew up?”Sometimes I worry people will say I ’m boring these days , but honestly , thank God I ’m boring . Thank God!”It ’s not an easy question , but she has a thoughtful answer : “ I would want my children to understand that whatever my artistry means to them is totally up to them . I would never actually want to shape it or tell them how to think about me . Maybe other than that I just did my best . And tried to stay true to myself along the way . That ’s something Michael and I have talked about a lot — allowing our kids to be their own people . It ’s such an intense thing for kids coming into the world . And they ’re told how to think and what to believe in and how to eat … I just kind of want to let my kids find out who they are . ’ ” Unless , she jokes , they want to work in entertainment . “My kid might one day say , ‘ Mom , why do you do these things ? I saw a funny video of you dressed up . ’ Most certainly that will happen . And you know , maybe it ’s okay to say , ‘ What do you think?’”As a parent to a 6 - year - old myself , I warn Gaga that kids will bring you down to earth with a thud . In fact , I go as far as to show her a note my daughter has written to the pop star on hearing that I will be interviewing her on Saturday afternoon , and not taking her to the toy shop as planned . “ Lady Gaga , ” it reads in pink pen . “ I like you , but your [ sic ] not the best . ”Yep , I say , kids are endlessly humbling . Gaga thinks the note is hilarious . “ Oh , I ’m ready , ” she says , folding the scrap of paper and putting it in her jacket pocket for those moments , we laugh , when she ’s getting too big for her boots .

I’m so pleased Gaga has a great sense of humor — not least because that note could have really backfired otherwise . I take the opportunity to ask if she has a favorite meme of herself . “ I like bus , club , another club because it ’s me saying something about how hard I work , but it comes across in this really funny way . So , there ’s something good at the heart of it . ”Lady Gaga is just two years away from 40 . So what is she most interested in understanding about herself today?“This is going to be the most weird answer . I ’d actually like things to be less about me . I really want to be there for people around me as much as I can . That ’s the thing that makes me the most happy . That does n’t mean I do n’t want to be an artist . But I think the thing I ’d like in my forties is to discover all the ways I can show up better for people in my life . All the ways that I can create positivity and joy . Music ’s just one way that I do it . ”For Gaga , a full life in the not - too - distant future will involve “ me and Michael and our kids , ” she states without a shadow of a doubt . “ Sometimes I worry people will say I ’m boring these days , but honestly , thank God I ’m boring . Thank God ! Because I was living on the edge . I do n’t know what was going to happen to me living that way . So the fact that I have these answers , on the one hand , I ’m like , ‘ Oh man , snooze fest ! ’ But actually , I ’m so grateful . Because I found a sense of happiness and joy that is true to me . ”Hair by Akki Shirakawa at Art Partner ; makeup by Frankie Boyd at Streeters ; manicure by Miho Okawara ; produced by Dana Brockman at Viewfinders .

She ’s funny , self - deprecating , warm , and comfortingly present . I ca n’t help but wonder what dark arts , what spell it is that transforms her into such terrifyingly brilliant powerhouse of performer . She ’s gearing up for the release of her seventh album , after what fans ( a.k.a . Monsters ) might consider creative detours , but she feels are all part of the same journey — an album of jazz standards with Tony Bennett , and Harlequin , companion to the Joker sequel , Folie à Deux . The appetite for this record is huge . Her last pop album , Chromatica , dropped at the height of the pandemic and missed out on the hype it deserved . So the Monsters are hangry . I ’m here to tell them that her latest album , Mayhem , is feast . She moves from the sofa where we ’ve been chatting to chair by mixing board , to play the new songs . This is moment million Monsters would kill for , and my gay panic subsides , I ’m taking it all in . Gaga bounces in her seat , stomps her black boots , and seems as excited to be listening to it as I am . I can not wait to be at club surrounded by my queer friends dancing to this record .   It ’s euphoric , like sharp inhale . I feel it in my chest , my heart . “ We need this ! ” I tell her . She smiles , sweetly relieved that I love it . The sound is hard to pin down . She describes one track as “ happy apocalyptic tune ” and says her influences include “ ’ 90s alternative , electro - grunge , Prince and Bowie melodies , guitar and attitude , funky bass lines , French electronic dance , and analog synths . ” From genre perspective , she says , “ Mayhem is utter chaos ! ” She adds the record "" just feels good to . It sounds good . It breaks lot of rules and has lot of fun . ”When making music Gaga sees wall of color — phenomenon known as synesthesia . “ As I ’m writing , it assembles in my brain , then through the recording it becomes full piece of color , ” she says . “ Every song is different shade . lot of the songs on this album have maroon , brown color to them . ‘ Bad Romance ’ was like that — it was reddish . ”I ask how she knows if song is going to be hit . “ There are great records that I make that will have their moment of completion and I ’ll go , it ’s not hit , but I love it , ” she says . “ Other records , I ’ll just know that it has everything it needs . hit is very powerful at conveying that the energy in the artist is going to get transferred into the listener . ”Gray SorrentiTop , shorts , Rick Owens .

Whereas in the past Gaga might have approached new album with fully formed idea of the work she ’s about to make , knowing what it ’s going to be called and even what the art will look like , with this , she tells “ I was actually pretty hard on myself about not walking into the studio with any preconceived ideas that I was going to strangle onto . Mayhem is about following your own chaos into whatever cranny of your life that it takes you to . And in that way , it was about following the songs . Writing as many songs as I did for this album was labour of love . And then you just have to be very cutthroat by the end . ”She confesses that , up until now , she had always felt it was her stage name , Gaga , that created the music . Now she recognizes that “ it came from . I ’m the creator and I made all of it , and that helped to value myself as musician and songwriter in deeper way . ” I ask if this realization means she might drop the stage name . She looks aghast at the suggestion ( phew ! ) and rushes to say , “ ! I love being Lady Gaga . I love being . I just mean that I became star when I was 20 . Everything gets reflected back to you that this persona is what makes you special . ”We talk about this separation of public and private self and how it has affected her over two decades . She admits to having “ broken feeling ” about some of the mental health issues she has had in her life . “ I feel some embarrassment , and that ’s very vulnerable thing to share . But I think through making this album , I was able to really love myself through all of that . Confronting the music was way of confronting some of the things I ’ve been through and saying , ‘ It ’s okay that ’s who you are . ’ And celebrating that about myself , instead of trying to pretend it ’s not real . ” Gray SorrentiTop , gloves , Valentino . Necklace , Tiffany & Co. She tells that making Mayhem was process of rediscovery . “ The chaos I thought was long gone is fully intact and ready to greet whenever I ’d like . Part of the message of even the first song on the album is that your demons are with you in the beginning and they are with you in the end , and I do n’t mean it in bleak way . Maybe we can make friends sooner with this reality instead of running all the time . ” I wonder if embracing the darkness inside rather than trying to kill it with the artificial brightness of spotlight has allowed Gaga to let in something softer , more natural , closer to sunshine . She ’s valuing the small moments at home with her friends , her dogs , and her fiancé , Michael Polansky , as much as , if not more than , the performances . “ Everyday poetry , ” she calls it . She explains that even though the “ Disease ” video is so dark in way , the process of creating it was n’t painful . “ It was easier to make it [ she was at peace with the darkness ] . It felt really fun and celebratory . Like throwing party for all your demons . “I used to drink lot and smoke lot , and I was always looking for an out . I used to call it the trapdoor . And I stopped doing that . I actually started feeling it . Being present . ”After the interview , Gaga introduces to Polansky , 41 - year - old venture capitalist . Gaga ’s mother set the pair up after meeting him at charity event and telling her daughter , “ I ’ve met your future husband . ” Polansky has kind face and gentle energy . also reads as completely - celebrity - coded ( despite being multimillionaire himself ) , more like good - looking dad you might chat with at the school drop - off . “What did you think of the music ? ” asks , proudly wrapping an arm around his wife - to - be . grins when I say that I love it and then laughs , because it ’s not as if made it . “You helped loads , though , ” Gaga says , staring lovingly up at him . “ You helped write , like , seven songs!”Later , Polansky and I talk on the phone . says : “ It ’s been one of the most incredible parts of this chapter of my life , to live with and coexist alongside someone making art and being creative in ways that very few people get to experience . I think of myself as really lucky to have been there for it . ” ’s loved watching her evolve in the years they ’ve known each other , and particularly says , “ return to finding lot of joy in making art , performing , and writing music . ”“This album was so much fun to watch her make , ” adds . “ She recorded it right down the street from our house , so we could easily walk back and forth from the studio . I spent lot of time with her , bringing my laptop to work while she was there . What surprised most was how fast she is . I could n’t believe how quickly song would take shape . Within five minutes , 80 percent of the song would have come from nothing . ”   Gray SorrentiDress , headpiece , Issey Miyake . Necklace , brooch , Tiffany & Co.

I’m interested in what it ’s like navigating relationship with someone so famous . “ Accepting that you wo n’t have the privacy others might have was the hardest part , ” says . “ But Stefani ’s comfort with it and patience with has been amazing . Our relationship is probably lot like everyone else ’s . We just have to figure out how to do some of it in public . That makes it even more important for us to have strong friendships and close family relationships . We find normalcy where we can . ”With Polansky , Gaga ’s life has different shade to it ; it ’s more wholesome . “ used to say to when we first met , ‘ You are special human being when the cameras are n’t on you . And I get to see that all the time , ’ ” she tells . They love to host at their L.A. home . “ We make pasta together ; we roast things . We also really like making simple dishes with Michael ’s mom , who lives nearby . ” It ’s secret that Gaga gets on well with older people ( “ I loved Tony Bennett ” ) and calls her own mother one of her best friends , alongside Michael ’s mother , Ellen . “ She and I have built our friendship by sharing our life experiences with each other . It ’s about the way we grew up , being woman in the workplace , what her experience was like and what mine is like , and kind of tracking different generations . ”Gray SorrentiDress , Gaga ’s own . Tights , Valentino . Gloves , Bagagerie . Necklace , Tiffany & Co. Shoes , Acne Studios . Gray SorrentiCoat , headpiece , Alexander McQueen . She tells story . “ while ago my friend Margo was over , and we were talking about lots of things , but at some point I showed her the ‘ Disease ’ video , and she was smiling . And then she said to , ‘ You know , this girl’”—that is , the one violently writhing around while chained to pole , and the bloody - eyed , latex - clad demon puking up black bile—“‘well , she also makes great broccoli . ’ It was really sweet moment where somebody that I love and care about knows that as much as I wanted her to like my video , making her dinner was the number one joy of my evening . ”Joy . There ’s lot more of it in her life these days . She ’s finding it in “ real conversations , real relationships , the authentic stories that we share with each other . I think there ’s an element of ‘ Fake it till you make it ’ all the time in life … but I also believe in being real , with yourself and with people around you . And I think , sometimes , when we have those real conversations , we can feel less alone . ” We meet six days after the results of the American election are announced . Mayhem has been unleashed on global political stage — one could accuse Gaga of not reading the room . “ What ’s bizarre is I did not write this album thinking that this would happen . I prayed it would not . But here we are . ”Gaga endorsed Kamala Harris . She also performed at Biden ’s inauguration in 2021 , which she has previously called one of the proudest moments of her life . I ask how she ’s been feeling . “ The main thing is I have so much compassion and love for so many people who are afraid today . I want to acknowledge that I ’m very blessed person , and I feel grateful for so much in my life every day . I know for lot of people , this election was devastating for their existence , so community is going to be the number one thing . I am one of many people who support the [ LGBTQ and other marginalized ] communities . And we ’re not going down without fight . We will stick together . It ’s going to be hard , but I ’m up for it . We ’re up for it . And I just want everyone to know how deeply they ’re loved and not invisible . ” Gray SorrentiBlouse , tights , gloves , Valentino . Necklace , Tiffany & Co. The music industry has changed so much since Lady Gaga released her first album , The Fame , in 2008 : social media , streaming , and , finally , music ’s own # MeToo moment , with some high - profile people being held accountable for their abuse of power . Right now , pop is celebrating strong women artists like never before and giving them the space to be themselves . Billie Eilish , Chappell Roan , Sabrina Carpenter , Charli XCX—“They’re amazing , ” Gaga says . “ They ’re strong and vibrant and creative and artistic . I think they ’re being celebrated because they ’re wonderful . ”If she could tell these younger pop artists anything , “ it would be that the whole you matters . Who you are at home is just as valuable as who you are when you ’re onstage . And matter what anyone says to you , you can value who you are outside of all of this . ” She takes beat then adds , “ I ’ve been in this business for years . Being woman and product at the same time was really exhausting . ”The artwork for the new album plays with this duality , but it ’s not as simple as public and private , good and bad , light and dark — it is about what she calls “ radical acceptance ” of all of it — of the mayhem . She says she ’s “ having lot of fun exploring imagery that is different from things that I ’ve done before . Things that used to really scare are now really exciting . ”“Such as?”“Well , playing with transgressive and challenging themes that make think of my own anxiety . I could n’t do that for really long time . And now it ’s just what I naturally want to do . It ’s interesting that I could go through period of being afraid as person and wanting nothing to do with those themes and then feeling good now and being like , ‘ Let ’s do all this dark stuff . ’”The concept of radical acceptance comes up lot during our chat , and feels key to the message she wants to convey about who she is and how she feels about her life and art right now . “ I ’m not going to torture myself , ” she says . “ I ’m going to celebrate . I used to drink lot and smoke lot , and I was always looking for an out . I used to call it the trapdoor . I used to be like , ‘ I need an escape route . ’ And I stopped doing that . And I actually started feeling it . Being present . As an artist , it ’s hard to go through that and not want to share that with my fans . ”Accepting that you wo n’t have the privacy others might have was the hardest part . But Stefani ’s comfort with it and patience with has been amazing . ”—Michael PolanskyWe talk about failure , not word I associate with the megastar . But Joker : Folie à Deux has had mixed reviews . “ People just sometimes do n’t like some things , ” she says matter - of - factly . “ It ’s that simple . And I think to be an artist , you have to be willing for people to sometimes not like it . And you keep going even if something did n’t connect in the way that you intended . ” She adds that the fear of failure is what can be really damaging : “ When that makes its way into your life , that can be hard to get control of . It ’s part of the mayhem . ”Embracing demons , darkness , nightmares , and the sprawling i d that bubbles just below the surface in all of us reminds Gaga of her love for Alexander McQueen , Isabella Blow , and Daphne Guinness : “ There are amazing artists throughout history who had relationship to dark poetry as way of feeling alive . ” But for Gaga , there were several years when she lost track of where the darkness began and ended . “ It was everywhere all the time . And that was not sustainable life . ”“So now , the darkness is more specific or channeled ? ” I ask . “ Yeah , channel it in the music and onstage , but then in my life … ”“You’re making the broccoli?”“Exactly!”It remains to be seen just how being in this new place will affect Gaga ’s style and approach to fashion . On the ELLE shoot , she brought her own looks from home to try out and she ’s not about to stop having fun with the more outlandish costumes we love her for — in fact , the eponymous character of Mayhem who haunts this album and drives the car in the ‘ Disease ’ video presents ample opportunities to play with gothic subversion . But , Gaga tells , “ I ’m just trying to feel as in my skin as possible and not like I ’m performing all the time . ”She adds , “ I feel really at ease about fashion and clothes . For , I ’m at place in my life where I just want to feel like myself in clothes . Whatever that means . So if that ’s changing , I just want to go with that feeling . ”Most recently , she ’s been wearing lot of baby doll dresses , because she ’s become fascinated with porcelain dolls . “ They ’re so fragile . And they ’re beautiful too . ” She used to be scared of them , and we agree they ’re pretty freaky , but as with so many things now she ’s leaning into that old fear and reclaiming it . Family has always been steadying force for Gaga . But now , for the first time , she ’s considering starting her own with Michael . “ Family — it ’s like the roots of the tree , ” she says . “ They grow long , and sometimes they ’re mangled , and sometimes they ’re full of water , and sometimes they ’re thirsty . Family is what makes you who you are , and it also defines your need for change . ”“If you were to have child , ” I ask , “ what would you want them to understand about you as an artist and also as person as they grew up?”Sometimes I worry people will say I ’m boring these days , but honestly , thank God I ’m boring . Thank God!”It ’s not an easy question , but she has thoughtful answer : “ I would want my children to understand that whatever my artistry means to them is totally up to them . I would never actually want to shape it or tell them how to think about . Maybe other than that I just did my best . And tried to stay true to myself along the way . That ’s something Michael and I have talked about lot — allowing our kids to be their own people . It ’s such an intense thing for kids coming into the world . And they ’re told how to think and what to believe in and how to eat … I just kind of want to let my kids find out who they are . ’ ” Unless , she jokes , they want to work in entertainment . “My kid might one day say , ‘ Mom , why do you do these things ? I saw funny video of you dressed up . ’ Most certainly that will happen . And you know , maybe it ’s okay to say , ‘ What do you think?’”As parent to 6 - year - old myself , I warn Gaga that kids will bring you down to earth with thud . In fact , I go as far as to show her note my daughter has written to the pop star on hearing that I will be interviewing her on Saturday afternoon , and not taking her to the toy shop as planned . “ Lady Gaga , ” it reads in pink pen . “ I like you , but your [ sic ] not the best . ”Yep , I say , kids are endlessly humbling . Gaga thinks the note is hilarious . “ Oh , I ’m ready , ” she says , folding the scrap of paper and putting it in her jacket pocket for those moments , we laugh , when she ’s getting too big for her boots . Gray SorrentiDress , bodysuit , Abra . Tights , Falke . Necklace , brooch , Tiffany & Co. Shoes , Ann Demeulemeester . I’m so pleased Gaga has great sense of humor — not least because that note could have really backfired otherwise . I take the opportunity to ask if she has favorite meme of herself . “ I like bus , club , another club because it ’s saying something about how hard I work , but it comes across in this really funny way . So , there ’s something good at the heart of it . ”Lady Gaga is just two years away from 40 . So what is she most interested in understanding about herself today?“This is going to be the most weird answer . I ’d actually like things to be less about . I really want to be there for people around as much as I can . That ’s the thing that makes the most happy . That does n’t mean I do n’t want to be an artist . But I think the thing I ’d like in my forties is to discover all the ways I can show up better for people in my life . All the ways that I can create positivity and joy . Music ’s just one way that I do it . ”For Gaga , full life in the not - too - distant future will involve “ and Michael and our kids , ” she states without shadow of doubt . “ Sometimes I worry people will say I ’m boring these days , but honestly , thank God I ’m boring . Thank God ! Because I was living on the edge . I do n’t know what was going to happen to living that way . So the fact that I have these answers , on the one hand , I ’m like , ‘ Oh man , snooze fest ! ’ But actually , I ’m so grateful . Because I found sense of happiness and joy that is true to . ”Hair by Akki Shirakawa at Art Partner ; makeup by Frankie Boyd at Streeters ; manicure by Miho Okawara ; produced by Dana Brockman at Viewfinders .

"" the main thing be i have so much compassion and love for so many people who be afraid today . i want to acknowledge that i ’m a very blessed person , and i feel grateful for so much in my life every day . i know for a lot of people , this election be devastating for their existence , so community be go to be the number one thing . i be one of many people who support the [ lgbtq and other marginalize ] community . and we ’re not go down without a fight . we will stick together . it ’s go to be hard , but i ’m up for it . we ’re up for it . and i just want everyone to know how deeply they ’re love and not invisible . "" gray sorrentiblouse , tight , glove , valentino . necklace , tiffany & co. the music industry have change so much since lady gaga release her first album , the fame , in 2008 : social medium , streaming , and , finally , music ’s own # metoo moment , with some high - profile people be hold accountable for their abuse of power . right now , pop be celebrate strong woman solo artist like never before and give they the space to be themselves . billie eilish , chappell roan , sabrina carpenter , charli xcx—“they’re amazing , "" gaga say . "" they ’re strong and vibrant and creative and artistic . i think they ’re be celebrate because they ’re wonderful . ”if she could tell these young pop artist anything , "" it would be that the whole you matter . who you be at home be just as valuable as who you be when you ’re onstage . and no matter what anyone say to you , you can value who you be outside of all of this . "" she take a beat then add , "" i ’ve be in this business for year . be a woman and a product at the same time be really exhausting . ”the artwork for the new album play with this duality , but it ’s not as simple as public and private , good and bad , light and dark — it be about what she call a "" radical acceptance "" of all of it — of the mayhem . she say she ’s "" have a lot of fun explore imagery that be different from thing that i ’ve do before . thing that use to really scare i be now really exciting . ”“such as?”“well , play with transgressive and challenging theme that make i think of my own anxiety . i could not do that for a really long time . and now it ’ just what i naturally want to do . it ’ interesting that i could go through a period of be afraid as a person and want nothing to do with those theme and then feel good now and be like , ' let ’s do all this dark stuff . ’”the concept of radical acceptance come up a lot during our chat , and feel key to the message she want to convey about who she be and how she feel about her life and art right now . "" i ’m not go to torture myself , "" she say . "" i ’m go to celebrate . i use to drink a lot and smoke a lot , and i be always look for an out . i use to call it the trapdoor . i use to be like , ' i need an escape route . ' and i stop do that . and i actually start feel it . be present . as an artist , it ’ hard to go through that and not want to share that with my fan . ”accepting that you will not have the privacy other might have be the hard part . but stefani ’s comfort with it and patience with i have be amazing . ”—michael polanskywe talk about failure , not a word i associate with the megastar . but joker : folie à deux have have mixed review . "" people just sometimes do n’t like some thing , "" she say matter - of - factly . "" it ’ that simple . and i think to be an artist , you have to be willing for people to sometimes not like it . and you keep go even if something do not connect in the way that you intend . "" she add that the fear of failure be what can be really damaging : "" when that make its way into your life , that can be hard to get control of . it ’ part of the mayhem . ”embrace demon , darkness , nightmare , and the sprawl i d that bubble just below the surface in all of we remind gaga of her love for alexander mcqueen , isabella blow , and daphne guinness : "" there be amazing artist throughout history who have a relationship to dark poetry as a way of feel alive . "" but for gaga , there be several year when she lose track of where the darkness begin and end . "" it be everywhere all the time . and that be not a sustainable life . ”“so now , the darkness be more specific or channel ? "" i ask . "" yeah , channel it in the music and onstage , but then in my life … ”“you’re make the broccoli?”“exactly!”it remain to be see just how be in this new place will affect gaga ’s style and approach to fashion . on the elle shoot , she bring her own look from home to try out and she ’s not about to stop have fun with the more outlandish costume we love she for — in fact , the eponymous character of mayhem who haunt this album and drive the car in the ' disease ' video present ample opportunity to play with gothic subversion . but , gaga tell i , "" i ’m just try to feel as in my skin as possible and not like i ’m perform all the time . ”she add , "" i feel really at ease about fashion and clothe . for i , i ’m at a place in my life where i just want to feel like myself in clothe . whatever that mean . so if that ’s change , i just want to go with that feeling . ”most recently , she ’s be wear a lot of baby doll dress , because she ’s become fascinated with porcelain doll . "" they ’re so fragile . and they ’re beautiful too . "" she use to be scared of they , and we agree they ’re pretty freaky , but as with so many thing now she ’s lean into that old fear and reclaim it . family have always be a steadying force for gaga . but now , for the first time , she ’s consider start her own with michael . "" family — it ’s like the root of the tree , "" she say . "" they grow long , and sometimes they ’re mangle , and sometimes they ’re full of water , and sometimes they ’re thirsty . family be what make you who you be , and it also define your need for change . ”“if you be to have a child , "" i ask , "" what would you want they to understand about you as an artist and also as a person as they grow up?”sometime i worry people will say i ’m bore these day , but honestly , thank god i ’m bore . thank god!”it ’s not an easy question , but she have a thoughtful answer : "" i would want my child to understand that whatever my artistry mean to they be totally up to they . i would never actually want to shape it or tell they how to think about i . maybe other than that i just do my good . and try to stay true to myself along the way . that ’ something michael and i have talk about a lot — allow our kid to be their own people . it ’ such an intense thing for kid come into the world . and they ’re tell how to think and what to believe in and how to eat … i just kind of want to let my kid find out who they be . ' "" unless , she joke , they want to work in entertainment . “my kid might one day say , ' mom , why do you do these thing ? i see a funny video of you dress up . ' most certainly that will happen . and you know , maybe it ’ okay to say , ' what do you think?’”as a parent to a 6 - year - old myself , i warn gaga that kid will bring you down to earth with a thud . in fact , i go as far as to show she a note my daughter have write to the pop star on hear that i will be interview she on saturday afternoon , and not take she to the toy shop as plan . "" lady gaga , "" it read in pink pen . "" i like you , but your [ sic ] not the good . ”yep , i say , kid be endlessly humble . gaga think the note be hilarious . "" oh , i ’m ready , "" she say , fold the scrap of paper and put it in her jacket pocket for those moment , we laugh , when she ’s get too big for her boot . gray sorrentidress , bodysuit , abra . tights , falke . necklace , brooch , tiffany & co. shoes , ann demeulemeester . i’m so please gaga have a great sense of humor — not least because that note could have really backfire otherwise . i take the opportunity to ask if she have a favorite meme of herself . "" i like bus , club , another club because it ’s i say something about how hard i work , but it come across in this really funny way . so , there ’ something good at the heart of it . ”lady gaga be just two year away from 40 . so what be she most interested in understanding about herself today?“this be go to be the most weird answer . i ’d actually like thing to be less about i . i really want to be there for people around i as much as i can . that ’ the thing that make i the most happy . that do not mean i do not want to be an artist . but i think the thing i ’d like in my forty be to discover all the way i can show up well for people in my life . all the way that i can create positivity and joy . music ’s just one way that i do it . ”for gaga , a full life in the not - too - distant future will involve "" i and michael and our kid , "" she state without a shadow of a doubt . "" sometimes i worry people will say i ’m bore these day , but honestly , thank god i ’m bore . thank god ! because i be live on the edge . i do not know what be go to happen to i live that way . so the fact that i have these answer , on the one hand , i ’m like , ' oh man , snooze f !
